**I made a Slack bot!**

Following up on a previous post (*The Hack Club Problem*), where I questioned my limited skill level and knowledge and asked, “How am I going to make a Slack bot in 18 days?”, I’m happy to say I’ve somehow done it!

What started out as Josh’s Servant, which literally just spit my Last.fm “now playing” into a channel—has evolved into Slack Annoyance, a jack-of-some-trades, master-of-none bot. It posts Last.fm now playing to a channel, `/acnhquote` for Animal Crossing quotes, Greg (an AI bot that commits Hackatime fraud), Geoff (who catches Hackatime fraudsters), and a welcomer bot.

I would be lying if I said I did this alone, Kyle (Dekoder-py) also maintains the bot and has the Lastfm and welcomer bot setup in his channel. Without him, Slack annoyance would still be just lastfm.

However, a cool Slack Bot cant replace the utility of workflows. Winterflows now exist, which are a workflow replacement. However, (No offense to the creator of winterflows) there was something so easy and effortless about workflows. I litreally made my welcomer workflow _on the bus_. 

Thats about all I have for you right now, and I'll see some of you in the Flavortown Kitchen.
